This project was my first jump into coding! Although it's not exactly polished It's helped me learn a lot of new things. The basic idea was to create some sort of game I could play for myself whenever I'm bored and have no internet(who am I kidding I'll just play other video games) but anyways here's to the start of a long journey!
